# JFSD-Project
The **Online Health Care System** is a Spring Boot-based Web MVC application designed to manage users in roles such as Admin, Employee, and Patient. It offers core features like user registration, login, password management, and employee data viewing. Built using the MVC architecture, it separates concerns through controllers, services, and repositories, with data access handled via Spring Data JPA. The frontend interface is developed using JSP pages and styled with static resources like images. The project uses Maven for build management and is configured through the `application.properties` file. Developed in Eclipse, this project serves as a solid academic or training-level implementation for full stack Java development.
